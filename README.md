This repository contains all the homework assignments which I completed during the first semester of my freshman year at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for Computer Science I. The class featured 8 different homeworks all of which were completed in python. Sample input and output files are provided (when possible) to give a better understanding of how each piece of code works.
